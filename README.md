# 21cmFirstCLASS - SFRstudies branch
### Editors: S. Libanore, T. Kadosh

In this branch, we study how modifications to the SFR model affect the output of `21cmFirstCLASS`. 

`21cmFirstCLASS` is an extension of the popular `21cmFAST` code that interfaces with `CLASS` to generate initial conditions at recombination that are consistent with the input cosmological model. These initial conditions can be set during the time of recombination, allowing one to compute the 21cm signal (and its spatial fluctuations) throughout the dark ages, as well as in the proceeding cosmic dawn and reionization epochs, just like in the standard `21cmFAST`.
